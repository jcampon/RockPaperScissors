# Rock Paper Scissors

__An ASP.Net MVC implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game "Rock Paper Scissors"__ 

Write an application that lets you play Rock-Paper-Scissors according to this criteria:

* I can play Player vs Computer 
* I can play Computer vs Computer
* I can play a different game each time
* Write a scaled-down version (think minimum viable product), small and well crafted
* Write the application with high unit test coverage and well factored code

Technical Constraints/Considerations
                                                  
* Doesn't necessarily need a flashy GUI (can be simple)                                
* Use .NET toolset (i.e. c#) and any associated plug ins you see fit 			   
* Use best industry practices
